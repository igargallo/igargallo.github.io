    <h1>My Cybersecurity Portfolio</h1>
    <p>Thanks for stopping by! In this portfolio, you’ll find a collection of my projects, skills, and certifications in cybersecurity. It reflects my dedication to improving security practices and tackling the challenges we face in the digital world. I’m excited to share my work with you!</p>
    
    <h2>Portfolio Projects</h2>
    <div class="portfolio-item">
        <h3>Project 1:Botium Toys Cybersecurity Audit </h3>
        <p>A Conducted a comprehensive audit of Botium Toys' cybersecurity program to align business practices with industry standards. 
            This involved assessing user permissions, implementing controls, and protocols in systems such as accounting, endpoint detection, firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and SIEM tools. 
            The audit identified high-risk vulnerabilities, documented findings, and provided remediation plans. Collaborated with stakeholders to present recommendations for improving the organization's security posture, 
            ensuring compliance with the NIST Cybersecurity Framework and establishing policies for better user credential management.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="portfolio-item">
        <h3>Project 2: Use the NIST Cybersecurity Framework to respond to a security incident</h3>
        <p>Created a comprehensive incident report analyzing a Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attack that compromised a multimedia company's internal network for two hours. 
         Utilized the National Institute of Standards and Technology's Cybersecurity Framework (NIST CSF) to assess the incident, including identifying security risks, protecting internal assets, detecting potential security incidents, and planning effective response and recovery strategies. 
            The report detailed the attack's impact, the cybersecurity team's immediate response (blocking incoming ICMP packets and implementing new firewall rules), and proposed measures for enhancing network security, such as improved monitoring and incident detection capabilities. 
            This proactive approach aims to strengthen communication and transparency with stakeholders while improving overall cybersecurity practices within the organization.</p>

    <div class="portfolio-item">
        <h3>Project 3: UManaging File Permissions in Linux</h3>
        <p>Developed a portfolio document showcasing proficiency in using Linux commands to manage file permissions within a large organization's file system. 
            This activity involved examining existing permissions to ensure they matched the required user authorizations, identifying unauthorized access, and modifying permissions accordingly. 
            Documented the specific commands used during the process, reinforcing skills in maintaining system security for the research team. </p>

     </div>
    <div class="portfolio-item">
        <h3>Project 4: Applying Filters to SQL Queries</h3>
        <p>.Created a portfolio document demonstrating the use of SQL to apply filters in queries, specifically utilizing the AND, OR, and NOT operators. 
            This activity focused on investigating potential security issues related to login attempts and employee machines within a large organization's database. 
            Analyzed records from the employees and log_in_attempts tables, crafting SQL queries to retrieve relevant data for security assessment. 
            The completed document serves as a key component of my cybersecurity portfolio, enhancing my technical skills and preparing me for future job interviews.
